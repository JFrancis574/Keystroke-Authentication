## Structure:
All code elements are located inside the code folder. This includes the working application and the volumes of test code that has been written. Furthermore, located inside the test code folder is test data generated by me for the purpose of testing and development. My project makes use of a few crucial libraries such as numpy, sqlite, math and scipy among others. 

### Program Structure:
The program is constructed using the OOP philosphy. The program centres around classes which consist of objects. Running the program as of now (09/02/2022) consists of simply running the main.py file. Running it as of now, creates a user data repository and then sets the program running to check every 60 seconds.
