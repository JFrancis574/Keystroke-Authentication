abstract = {Summary User authentication is a crucial requirement for cloud service providers to prove that the outsourced data and services are safe from imposters. Keystroke dynamics is a promising behavioral biometrics for strengthening user authentication, however, current keystroke based solutions designed for certain datasets, for example, a fixed length text typed on a traditional personal computer keyboard and their authentication performances were not acceptable for other input devices nor free length text. Moreover, they suffer from a high dimensional feature space that degrades the authentication accuracy and performance. In this paper, a keystroke dynamics based authentication system is proposed for cloud environments that is applicable to fixed and free text typed on traditional and touch screen keyboards. The proposed system utilizes different feature extraction methods, as a preprocessing step, to minimize the feature space dimensionality. Moreover, different fusion rules are evaluated to combine the different feature extraction methods so that a set of the most relevant features is chosen. Because of the huge number of users' samples, a clustering method is applied to the users' profile templates to reduce the verification time. The proposed system is applied to three different benchmark datasets using three different classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.

abstract = {Clustering is a powerful vehicle to reveal and visualize structure of data. When dealing with time series, selecting a suitable measure to evaluate the similarities/dissimilarities within the data becomes necessary and subsequently it exhibits a significant impact on the results of clustering. This selection should be based upon the nature of time series and the application itself. When grouping time series based on their shape information is of interest (shape-based clustering), using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is a desirable choice. Using stretching or compressing segments of temporal data, DTW determines an optimal match between any two time series. In this way, time series exhibiting similar patterns occurring at different time periods, are considered as being similar. Although DTW is a suitable choice for comparing data with respect to their shape information, calculating the average of a collection of time series (which is required in clustering methods) based on this distance becomes a challenging problem. As the result, employing clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means (where the cluster centers – prototypes are calculated through averaging the data) along with the DTW distance is a challenging task and may produce unsatisfactory results. In this study, three alternatives for fuzzy clustering of time series using DTW distance are proposed. In the first method, a DTW-based averaging technique proposed in the literature, has been applied to the Fuzzy C-Means clustering. The second method considers a Fuzzy C-Medoids clustering, while the third alternative comes as a hybrid technique, which exploits the advantages of both the Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy C-Medoids when clustering time series. Experimental studies are reported over a set of time series coming from the UCR time series database.},

ABSTRACT = {Authentication methods using personal identification number (PIN) and unlock patterns are widely used in smartphone user authentication. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks, and PIN authentication, in particular, is poor in terms of security because PINs are short in length with just four to six digits. A wide range of research is currently underway to examine various biometric authentication methods, for example, using the user’s face, fingerprint, or iris information. However, such authentication methods provide PIN-based authentication as a type of backup authentication to prepare for when the maximum set number of authentication failures is exceeded during the authentication process such that the security of biometric authentication equates to the security of PIN-based authentication. In order to overcome this limitation, research has been conducted on keystroke dynamics-based authentication, where users are classified by analyzing their typing patterns while they are entering their PIN. As a result, a wide range of methods for improving the ability to distinguish the normal user from abnormal ones have been proposed, using the typing patterns captured during the user’s PIN input. In this paper, we propose unique keypads that are assigned to and used by only normal users of smartphones to improve the user classification performance capabilities of existing keypads. The proposed keypads are formed by randomly generated numbers based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. In an attempt to demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed unique keypad compared to existing keypads, all tests except for the keypad type were conducted under the same conditions in earlier work, including collection-related features and feature selection methods. Our experimental results show that when the filtering rates are 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, the corresponding equal error rates (EERs) for the proposed keypads are improved by 4.15%, 3.11%, 2.77%, 3.37% and 3.53% on average compared to the classification performance outcomes in earlier work.},
